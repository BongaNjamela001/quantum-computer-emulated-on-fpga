   abstract = {This paper reports the development of a highly efficient, flexible hardware platform, which is suitable for the control of spin-based quantum systems including quantum computation and quantum metrology. A two-channel arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), an eight-channel pulse/sequence generator, a two-channel analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a two-channel high-speed time-to-digital converter (TDC) are fully integrated on a printed circuit board (PCB). The AWG has a 1-GSa/s sampling rate and a 16-bit amplitude resolution. The pulse/sequence generator can continuously output pulse/sequence signals with a 50-ps time resolution and a dynamic range from 5 ns to 2 s. The ADC provides a 1-GSa/s sampling rate and a 12-bit amplitude resolution for analog signal acquisition. The TDC provides a 6-ps time resolution and a maximum sampling frequency of 125 MHz. All these modules are realized utilizing a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Customized data calculation modules are also implemented with the FPGA logic. The hardware was tested and implemented in a pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer and an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectrometer.},

Compared to software simulation with sequential execution, hardware emulation based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) can help to realize the intrinsic quantum parallelism.

   abstract = {Quantum computing emulators are widely used for testing quantum algorithms ideally before executing them on real quantum processors. Therefore, researchers are very active in developing emulators primarily on FPGAs. This project is complex and requires a long time and a specific expertise if carried out following the low-level design approach using a Hardware Description Language (HDL). This paper describes, step by step, the process of quick designing a quantum gate emulator using a much simpler high-level design approach. It begins with the development of a quantum gate simulator in the MATLAB® environment, and subsequently translates it into an HDL design for FPGA implementation by using the MATLAB's HDL Coder toolbox. However, while code translation may seem straightforward using MATLAB toolboxes, it becomes a non-trivial task when transitioning from a quantum computing simulator to an HDL-based quantum computing emulator. Thus, it was necessary to conduct an in-depth study to implement a quantum computing simulator in MATLAB, enabling an error-free translation of HDL code. The developed method enables the designer to leverage the highly useful and straightforward model-based design approach offered by MATLAB, rather than directly the more complex HDL approach, returning a highly optimized HDL code for configuring the FPGA as a quantum computing emulator. This topic makes the design of quantum emulators on FPGA quick, reliable, optimized and without the need for specialized hardware design skills. Additionally, two implementation examples have been described using Altera/Intel FPGA on development boards DE1_SoC and DE5a-NET DDR4 provided by Terasic Inc.},

This includes calculations that aim at probing regimes of quantum advantage, where a quantum computer outperforms a classical computer in the same task. High performance computing (HPC) platforms play a crucial role as today's quantum devices already reach beyond the limits of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation packages on a local HPC cluster using different parallelisation capabilities, and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic quantum computing tasks. Our results can help finding the right package for a given simulation task and lay the foundation for a systematic community effort to benchmark and validate upcoming versions of existing and also newly developed simulation packages.},

   abstract = {et al Published in Quantum Information and suitable for high-speed FPGA implementation. Computation VII (Proc. SPIE v.7342) ABSTRACT Conventional vector-based simulators for quantum computers are quite limited in the size of the quantum circuits they can handle, due to the worst-case exponential growth of even sparse representations of the full quantum state vector as a function of the number of quantum operations applied. However, this exponential-space requirement can be avoided by using general space-time tradeoffs long known to complexity theorists, which can be appropriately optimized for this particular problem in a way that also illustrates some interesting reformulations of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we describe the design and empirical space/time complexity measurements of a working software prototype of a quantum computer simulator that avoids excessive space requirements. Due to its space-efficiency, this design is well-suited to embedding in single-chip environments, permitting especially fast execution that avoids access latencies to main memory. We plan to prototype our design on a standard FPGA development board.},

   abstract = {QUDA is an architecture similar to CUDA for HPC applications of Quantum GPU architectures to be used in conjunction with GPU and MCU based processing. There is no QUDA pipeline similar to a stream processing architecture or an out of order instruction pipeline. True ILP is achieved with a QUDA architecture, which is better than quasi-parallelism in a CUDA or scalar/vector architecture. What: Quantum Unified Compute Architecture or QUDA architectures is the use of Q and Qiskit for a reconfigurable quantum array architecture on spintronic units with a reconfigurable scheduler for a quantum operating system. How: We consider a QUDA architecture in python to simulate a reconfigurable QPU cell-matrix on the Q cloud in association with a CUDA kernel. We consider the existence of shared memory and ultra-fast hyper-data support, with all other CUDA functionalities and libraries supported. Why: A large body of efficient quantum algorithms for stream processing, vector data processing and hyper-data algorithms in Hilbert space exist for very efficient HPC computing. With time it is possible that it be proven that P and NP are actual subsets of QP with polynomial-time convergence and bounds proven for most HPC workloads, enabling serious QPU designs to supplement the CUDA architecture. Low-temperature silicon or other non-linear materials like graphene at atomic scale fabrication will make inexpensive quantum integration possible leading to a revolution in 100 qubits + chip architectures as QPU units, to act as a coprocessor to MCU-GPU units. Thus QPU-MCU hybrid units unify with MCU-GPU-QPU hybrid units leading to the QUDA architecture. Summary: Main Points:},

   abstract = {Quantum annealing (QA) is a method to find the global optimum for a combinatorial optimization problem by using quantum fluctuations. QA can be simulated on a computer using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of the Ising model, while sacrificing a huge processing time. It has been shown that the processing time of QMC simulation on a CPU scales similarly to that of QA on the D-wave 2X quantum annealer, although the latter is over 10 8 times faster than the former. However, large problems should be partitioned into sub-problems and solved separately, and this reduces the processing speed of the quantum annealer. Since the access to a quantum annealer is also limited, acceleration of QA simulations using conventional computers is regarded as a very important topic. If we can reduce the huge computational time, it is possible to use QA simulations to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We propose an FPGA accelerator for QA simulations designed using “open computing language.” We achieved up to 12.6 times speed-up for single FPGA implementation and 23.8 times speed-up for two-FPGA implementation compared to a CPU. We also achieved over 9-times large energy efficiency compared to a CPU-based system.},

Up to now the discrete Fourier transform has been successfully applied to the field of quantum information, but the related short-time discrete Fourier transform of this field has not been developed accordingly. To address this problem, we first introduce the concept of quantum window state, and further prove that the quantum Fourier transform of a quantum window state is also a quantum window state. Based on the definition of the quantum window state the local information of a quantum signal is extracted and the corresponding quantum circuits are also given. And then, by applying the quantum Fourier transform to the windowed quantum superposition states, we propose a novel concept called quantum windowed Fourier transform (QWFT).

   abstract = {The integration of quantum processing units (QPUs) in a heterogeneous high-performance computing environment requires solutions that facilitate hybrid classical–quantum programming. Standards such as OpenCL facilitate the programming of heterogeneous environments, consisting of CPUs and hardware accelerators. This study presents an innovative method that incorporates QPU functionality into OpenCL, standardizing quantum processes within classical environments. By leveraging QPUs within OpenCL, hybrid quantum–classical computations can be sped up, impacting domains like cryptography, optimization problems, and quantum chemistry simulations. Using Portable Computing Language (Jääskeläinen et al. in Int J Parallel Program 43(5):752–785, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10766-014-0320-y) and the Qulacs library (Suzuki et al. in Quantum 5:559, 2021. https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2021-10-06-559), results demonstrate, for instance, the successful execution of Shor’s algorithm (Nielsen and Chuang in Quantum computation and quantum information, 10th anniversary edn. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010), serving as a proof of concept for extending the approach to larger qubit systems and other hybrid quantum–classical algorithms. This integration approach bridges the gap between quantum and classical computing paradigms, paving the way for further optimization and application to a wide range of computational problems.},

@article{Inam2020,
   abstract = {SENSE (Sensitivity Encoding) is a parallel MRI (pMRI) technique that allows accelerated data acquisition using multiple receiver coils and reconstructs the artifact-free images from the acquired under-sampled data. However, an increasing number of receiver coils has raised the computational demands of pMRI techniques to an extent where the reconstruction time on general purpose computers becomes impractically long for real-time MRI. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have recently emerged as a viable hardware platform for accelerating pMRI algorithms (e.g. SENSE). However, recent efforts to accelerate SENSE using FPGAs have been focused on a fixed number of receiver coils (L=8) and acceleration factor (Af=2). This paper presents a novel 32-bit floating-point FPGA-based hardware accelerator for SENSE (HW-ACC-SENSE); having an ability to work in coordination with an on-chip ARM processor performing reconstructions for different values of L and Af. Moreover, the proposed design provides flexibility to integrate multiple units of HW-ACC-SENSE with an on-chip ARM processor, for low-latency image reconstruction. The VIVADO High-Level-Synthesis (HLS) tool has been used to design and implement the HW-ACC-SENSE on the Xilinx FPGA development board (ZCU102). A series of experiments has been performed on in-vivo datasets acquired using 8, 12 and 30 receiver coil elements. The performance of the proposed architecture is compared with the single thread and multi-thread CPU-based implementations of SENSE. The results show that the proposed design withstands the reconstruction quality of the SENSE algorithm while demonstrating a maximum speed-gain up to 298× over the CPU counterparts in our experiments.},

We consider QFT-based color image filtering operations and their applications in image smoothing, sharpening, and selective filtering using quantum frequency domain filters. The underlying principle used for constructing the proposed quantum filters is to use the principle of the quantum Oracle to implement the filter function. Compared with the existing methods, our method is not only suitable for color images, but also can flexibly design the notch filters. We provide the quantum circuit that implements the filtering task and present the results of several simulation experiments on color images. The major advantages of the quantum frequency filtering lies in the exploitation of the efficient implementation of the quantum Fourier transform.},

Quadrature analog receivers have problems with channel matching, dc offset and analog-to-digital linearity. Fixed-point digital receivers (DRs) reduce all of these problems. We have demonstrated that a floating-point DR using large (order 124 to 512) FIR low-pass filters also overcomes these problems, automatically provides long word length and has low latency between signals. A preloaded table of finite impuls response (FIR) filter coefficients provides fast switching between one of 129 different one-stage and two-stage multrate FIR low-pass filters with bandwidths between 4 KHz and 125 KHz. This design has been implemented on a dual channel circuit board for a commercial MRI system.

   abstract = {In order to deal with the problems of poor anti-interference low reconstruction clarity and large errors in the traditional medical image reconstruction methods we proposed a fuzzy medical images three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method using quantum algorithm. First of all a feature matching model of fuzzy medical image was built. Secondly this study decomposed the edge contour features by using the Gaussian mixture feature matching method extracted the edge contour vectors of fuzzy medical image and enhanced the information of fuzzy medical images by adopting the region edge sharpening. Thirdly this study reorganized the 3D texture structure of images and reconstructed the sparse scattered points according to its texture and detail regions. Finally we combined with the gray histogram of fuzzy medical images to achieve the adaptive pixel reconstruction of fuzzy medical images and completed the 3D reconstruction of fuzzy medical images by employing the quantum algorithm. The results show that the proposed method is characterized by high matching degree of image features and balanced distribution of point clouds and the self-similarity coefficient of the reconstructed texture can reach 0.994; in addition the SINR value of the reconstruction result can be maintained around 100dB and it has lower error rate than the traditional method thereby improving the detection and recognition capability of medical images and the algorithm has certain practical application.},

@article{Fessler2005,
   abstract = {In some types of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, particularly functional brain scans, the conventional Fourier model for the measurements is inaccurate. Magnetic field inhomogeneities, which are caused by imperfect main fields and by magnetic susceptibility variations, induce distortions in images that are reconstructed by conventional Fourier methods. These artifacts hamper the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) in brain regions near air/tissue interfaces. Recently, iterative methods that combine the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm with nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) operations have been shown to provide considerably improved image quality relative to the conjugate-phase method. However, for non-Cartesian k-space trajectories, each CG-NUFFT iteration requires numerous k-space interpolations; these are operations that are computationally expensive and poorly suited to fast hardware implementations. This paper proposes a faster iterative approach to field-corrected MR image reconstruction based on the CG algorithm and certain Toeplitz matrices. This CG-Toeplitz approach requires k-space interpolations only for the initial iteration; thereafter, only fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) are required. Simulation results show that the proposed CG-Toeplitz approach produces equivalent image quality as th CG-NUFFT method with significantly reduced computation time. © 2005 IEEE.},

Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.< >},
