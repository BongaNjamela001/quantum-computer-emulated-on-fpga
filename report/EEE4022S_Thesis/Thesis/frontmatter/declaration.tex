\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	I know that plagiarism is wrong. Plagiarism is to use another’s work and pretend that it is one’s own.
	\item 
	I have used the IEEE convention for citation and referencing. Each contribution to, and quotation in, this report on Quantum Computer Emulated on FPGA from the work(s) of other people has been attributed and has been cited and referenced. Any section taken from an internet source has been referenced to that source.
	\item 
	This report on a Quantum Computer Emulated on FPGA is my own work and is in my own words (except where I have attributed it to others).
	\item 
	I have not paid a third party to complete my work on my behalf. My use of artificial intelligence software has been limited to restructuring and rewording my own work, debugging code that I have written and generating correcting grammar and spelling errors. (specify precisely how you used AI to assist with this assignment, and then give examples of the prompts you used in your first appendix).
	\item 
	I have not allowed and will not allow anyone to copy my work with the intention of passing it off as his or her own work.
	\item 
	I acknowledge that copying someone else’s assignment or essay, or part of it, is wrong, and declare that this is my own work.
