I would like to begin by thanking my parents for laying the foundation for the pursuit of knowledge through their achievements and teachings. 

I would like to thank and dedicate this work to my mother, without whom I would not have been able to complete this work.

Thank you to Dr Simon Winberg for being patient in providing expert guidance throughout my journey.

I would also like to give thanks to all my other brilliant teachers, in the present and the past, whose great insights have given me the opportunity to explore the wondrous world of science and engineering. 

Lastly, I would like to thank the Most High, who placed us in an unknown universe and hid great mysteries in the fabric of existence.
