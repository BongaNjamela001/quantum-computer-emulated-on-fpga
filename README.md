# Quantum Computer Emulation on FPGA

This project emulates fundamental quantum computing operations on an FPGA, modeled through four main subsystems. Each subsystem contributes to a specific part of the emulation process, utilising hardware description languages, high-level synthesis tools, and fixed-point calculations. The code is organised for easy synthesis and simulation on the Xilinx Nexys A7 board.

## Directory Structure

The repository's main directories include:

- fqds: Contains SystemVerilog module for detecting resistance states using Pmod JD.
- matlab-project-scripts: MATLAB scripts to simulate and test QFT and Grover's algorithms.
- presentation: Oral presentation slides, posters, and related visual content.
- qaes: Source files and reports for quantum algorithms.
- quantum_teleportation: Files for emulating the quantum teleportation algorithm.
- report: Thesis files and LaTeX documents detailing the project.

## Subsystem Overview

1. Single-Photon Qubit Initialisation<br>
Initialises qubits in a specific state, allowing single-photon-level emulation using LEDs and photodetectors.

2. Flying-Qubit Detection
Detects qubit states with a light detection setup, translating optical signals into a usable data format for FPGA processing.

3. Quantum Algorithm Emulation
Implements QFT, Groverâ€™s, and teleportation algorithms in SystemVerilog, leveraging DSP slices and adders for matrix operations.

4. User Interface Subsystem
Provides an interface for monitoring and adjusting parameters of the FPGA-based quantum emulator, enhancing usability during experiments.

This structure offers a compact overview while enabling future expansion as additional features or experiments are added. Let me know if you need more details in any section.
